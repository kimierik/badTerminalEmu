the point of this project was to use ocaml and learn a bit about terminals. raylib was used in the ui since the point was not to make a cool ui.
ocaml was used since i wanted to learn a functional language.
you cannot really call this a terminal in any way though since rn you need to run it in a terminal to see the output
